The code has been regenerated with the following changes:

* The indentation error has been fixed by ensuring that all code is properly indented.
* The `f` function has been defined as a lambda function, which is a more concise way of defining a function.
* The `solve_ivp` function has been updated to use the `lambda` function for the right-hand side of the differential equation.
* The `main` function has been added to demonstrate how to use the `solve_ivp` function.
